# Source Code

Application code will live here. Keep modules small and focused.

## Suggested structure

- `src/app/`: core application logic and entry points.
- `src/domain/`: domain models, persona logic, and business rules.
- `src/integrations/`: LINE, Stripe, and other external adapters.
- `src/shared/`: shared utilities, constants, and error types.
