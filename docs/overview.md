# Matatabi Engine Repository Overview

This repository contains the foundational structure for the Matatabi Engine service.
It is intentionally organized to keep security, product documentation, and code assets
separate and easy to maintain.

## Goals

- Provide a clear folder layout for future development.
- Make it easy to locate product documentation and operational notes.
- Keep configuration and scripts isolated from application code.

## High-level layout

- `docs/`: product and architecture documentation.
- `src/`: application source code.
- `config/`: environment-agnostic configuration templates.
- `scripts/`: operational and developer scripts.
- `tests/`: automated test suites.
